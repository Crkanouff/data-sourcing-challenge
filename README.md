# data-sourcing-challenge
Module Challenge 6

Module 6 Challenge's goal was to query information from 2 API's (The New York Times and The Movie Database).
We were to show our proficiency in downloading particular information from both API's, including
reviews, movie title names & etc. Finally, we were to merge the data anc clean it up.

Part 1:  Getting Data from the New York Times
Relatively easy to get the information and pull 0-20 pages of information sorted by the newest to oldes.  
Then, created a list to store the information, so that list could be used later in Part 2 of the challenge.
Information was converted to a dataFrame for sorting purposes and demonstration of skills.

Part 2 Getting information from The Movie Database
We built queries for this API and created a tmdb_movie_list to store these movie details.
Using a request count function/counter we made sure we kept track of how many queiries were made.
Loop function in Part 2 and assigning items from a dictionary to the list was tricky, 
but was able to get through it with some help.

Part 3 Merging and Cleaning
Used Merge to combine the two databases. Was able to delete some rows and clean up the data that
was included in the rows.  Finally, exported the data as a CSV file and pushed it back to my 
Github repository.
